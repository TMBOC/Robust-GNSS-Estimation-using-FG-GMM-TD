\section*{Library Enhancements for RINEX3}

Contributions are the force of change in an open source
project.  Over the last two years, thousands of modifications have
been submitted to the GPSTk subversion repository. Few of those
modifications have changed the interface to existing classes. Most of
the changes are new classes with new capabilities.
\mbox{RINEX-3} support is largely complete, and is
available through library functions in a new branch. It is the subject of
this section. The remainder of
the library modifications occurred in the trunk. These new
capabilities are described in the next section.
